    "### Overview of the Edgeworth Box\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Edgeworth box** is a graphical representation used in microeconomics to illustrate the distribution of resources (goods) between two consumers in a simple exchange economy. It shows all possible allocations of two goods between two consumers and helps analyze their preferences, trade possibilities, and potential for reaching Pareto-efficient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Consumers**: The consumers are trading Noodles and Cereal.\n",
    "- **Objective**: To visualize how these consumers can trade to reach mutually beneficial (Pareto-efficient) allocations based on their utility preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the main elements of your code to understand how it represents the economic concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Utility Functions (`U1` and `U2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Represent the satisfaction (utility) each consumer derives from consuming Noodles (X) and Cereal (Y).\n",
    "- **Form**: Must be functions of two variables, e.g., `U1(x, y)` and `U2(x, y)`.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: The shape of the utility functions reflects each consumer's preferences and marginal rates of substitution (MRS) between Noodles and Cereal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Edgeworth Box Dimensions (`Xmax`, `Ymax`, `Xmin`, `Ymin`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Xmax` and `Ymax`**: Total available quantities of Noodles and Cereal in the economy.\n",
    "- **`Xmin` and `Ymin`**: Set close to zero to avoid computational issues with logarithmic utilities or division by zero.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: The box's dimensions represent the entire feasible set of allocations between the two consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Indifference Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Curves along which a consumer derives the same level of utility.\n",
    "- **Implementation**: The code uses `plt.contour()` to draw these curves for both consumers.\n",
    "- **Economic Intuition**:\n",
    "    - **Consumer 1**: Indifference curves are plotted from the origin at (0,0).\n",
    "    - **Consumer 2**: Indifference curves are plotted from the opposite corner (Xmax, Ymax), reflecting that any consumption by Consumer 1 reduces the amount available to Consumer 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Contract Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The set of allocations where the indifference curves of the two consumers are tangent—i.e., where their MRS are equal.\n",
    "- **Implementation**:\n",
    "    - Calculated by finding where the gradients of the utility functions are proportional.\n",
    "    - The code computes gradients using `np.gradient()` and identifies where the determinant of the Jacobian (`out`) is zero.\n",
    "    - Plotted using `plt.contour()` with specific levels.\n",
    "- **Economic Intuition**: Represents all Pareto-efficient allocations—no consumer can be made better off without making the other worse off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Allocation Point (`AlPoint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Represents a specific allocation of Noodles and Cereal between the two consumers.\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "    - If provided, the code plots this point and the corresponding indifference curves passing through it for both consumers.\n",
    "    - Helps visualize the initial endowment and potential gains from trade.\n",
    "- **Economic Intuition**: Demonstrates how consumers can move from an initial allocation to a Pareto-efficient allocation through mutually beneficial trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Utility Levels and Number of Indifference Curves (`Utility_Show`, `Num_ind`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Utility_Show`**: When `True`, displays utility levels on the indifference curves.\n",
    "- **`Num_ind`**: Controls the number of indifference curves plotted for each consumer.\n",
    "- **Economic Intuition**: More curves provide a detailed view of preferences but may clutter the graph; adjusting `Num_ind` balances detail and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Other Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Labels (`Xlab`, `Ylab`)**: Axis labels for clarity—here, they should be set to \"Noodles\" and \"Cereal.\"\n",
    "- **Colors (`colors`)**: Customize the appearance of the plot elements for better distinction.\n",
    "- **Endowment (`e`)**: Number of steps used in calculations—higher values lead to smoother curves but increase computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Intuition Behind the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutually Beneficial Trade\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Starting Point**: Consumers begin with an initial allocation of Noodles and Cereal.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Through trade, both aim to reach higher indifference curves, thus achieving higher utility levels.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: The movement from the initial allocation point towards the contract curve represents this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: The rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining the same utility level.\n",
    "- **Equal MRS**: At points on the contract curve, both consumers have equal MRS, meaning they value the trade-off between Noodles and Cereal equally.\n",
    "- **Economic Intuition**: Equating MRS ensures that resources are allocated efficiently between the two consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pareto Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: An allocation is Pareto-efficient if no consumer can be made better off without making the other worse off.\n",
    "- **Contract Curve**: All points along this curve are Pareto-efficient allocations.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: The contract curve in the Edgeworth box shows all such allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Utility Maximization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consumers' Goal**: Each aims to reach the highest possible indifference curve given their budget constraints (the total available goods).\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Limited by the total quantities of Noodles and Cereal in the economy.\n",
    "- **Trade-Offs**: Consumers make choices based on their preferences, as depicted by the shapes of their indifference curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Horizontal Axis**: Quantity of Noodles consumed by Consumer 1 (Alice).\n",
    "- **Vertical Axis**: Quantity of Cereal consumed by Alice.\n",
    "- **Origin for Consumer 2 (Bob)**: Located at the top-right corner\n",
    "\n",
